# Samuel McAravey

I build enterprise software where reliability, data integrity, and messy real-world workflows matter-
payments, compliance, and operational systems that have to work every day.

My background mixes founder/CTO work with scaling and modernizing production systems. I’m most useful
when the problem is ambiguous, the stakes are high, and the path forward needs both technical depth
and execution discipline.

## What I Focus On

- B2B SaaS platforms (multi-tenant architecture, operational reliability)
- Payments + compliance workflows
- Enterprise integrations (ERPs and "back office" systems)
- Pragmatic modernization of legacy systems (shipping improvements without risky rewrites)

## A Few Things I’ve Built

### PayeWaive - Payments + compliance workflows for construction
Led the technology behind a B2B platform that connects accounting data with payment and compliance
workflows, including direct ERP integration.

### Custom ERP/MRP - Manufacturing operations from scratch
Built an internal ERP system for a manufacturing business: order intake → production planning (BOM)
→ packing/invoicing → accounting integration, including iPad-based shop-floor workflows.

### Nvoicepay (Corpay) - High-volume payments platform
Led teams delivering enterprise features and platform modernization, including delivery discipline
and reliability improvements, alongside large-scope initiatives like international payments.
