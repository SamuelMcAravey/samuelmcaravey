# Samuel McAravey

I build enterprise software where reliability, data integrity, and messy real-world workflows matter.  
Payments, compliance, and operational systems that have to work every day.

My background spans founder/CTO work and hands-on engineering in production environments. I’m most useful when the problem is ambiguous, the stakes are high, and execution matters as much as architecture.

## What I Focus On

- B2B SaaS platforms with real operational constraints
- Payments and compliance workflows
- Enterprise integrations (ERPs and back-office systems)
- Pragmatic modernization of legacy systems  
  (shipping improvements without risky rewrites)

## Selected Systems and Work

### PayeWaive — Payments and compliance workflows for construction

Led the technology behind a B2B platform connecting accounting data with payment and compliance workflows. The system integrates directly with customer ERPs and supports day-to-day operational use, not just demos.

Focus areas:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- ERP integration
- Reliability and operational correctness
- Payments and compliance workflows

---

### Custom ERP / MRP — Manufacturing operations built from scratch

Designed and built an internal ERP system for a manufacturing business covering:

- Order intake
- Production planning (BOMs and material calculations)
- Packing and invoicing
- Accounting integration
- iPad-based shop-floor workflows

The system was used daily by non-technical staff and tied directly into physical operations.

### Nvoicepay (Corpay) — High-volume B2B payments platform

Led teams delivering enterprise features and platform modernization for a high-volume payments system processing billions annually.

Work included:
- Delivery discipline and reliability improvements
- Infrastructure and platform modernization
- Large-scope initiatives such as international payments
- Collaboration across product, QA, and operations

---

## How I Work

- Prefer systems that fail predictably over systems that fail mysteriously
- Optimize for operational clarity, not theoretical purity
- Treat production issues as design feedback
- Avoid rewrites unless the cost of not rewriting is higher

I care about software that survives reality: real users, real data, real failures, and real operational constraints.
